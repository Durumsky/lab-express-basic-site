        <p>In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to
            mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the
            lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of
            rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils
            on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters
            of his income. The rest of it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches
            and shoes to match for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in
            his best homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece under
            twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used to saddle the hack as
            well as handle the bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours was bordering on
            fifty; he was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and a great
            sportsman. They will have it his surname was Quixada or Quesada (for here there
            is some difference of opinion among the authors who write on the subject), although from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he was called Quexana.
            This, however, is of but little importance to our tale; it will be enough not to stray
            a hairâ€™s breadth from the truth in the telling of it.</p>
